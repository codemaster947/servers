# MCP servers ![NPM Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/%40modelcontextprotocol%2Fexample-servers)

[![MIT License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

A collection of reference implementations and community-contributed servers for the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This repository showcases the versatility and extensibility of MCP, demonstrating how it can be used to give Large Language Models (LLMs) secure, controlled access to external tools and data sources.

## üåü Featured Servers

- **[Filesystem](src/filesystem)** - Secure file operations with configurable access controls
- **[GitHub](src/github)** - Repository management, file operations, and GitHub API integration
- **[Google Drive](src/gdrive)** - File access and search capabilities for Google Drive
- **[PostgreSQL](src/postgres)** - Read-only database access with schema inspection
- **[Slack](src/slack)** - Channel management and messaging capabilities
- **[Memory](src/memory)** - Knowledge graph-based persistent memory system
- **[Puppeteer](src/puppeteer)** - Browser automation and web scraping
- **[Brave Search](src/brave-search)** - Web and local search using Brave's API
- **[Google Maps](src/google-maps)** - Location services, directions, and place details

## üöÄ Getting Started

The servers in this repository can be used directly with `npx`. For example:

```sh
npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-memory
```

This will start the [Memory](src/memory) server. However, this isn't very useful on its own, and should instead be configured into an MCP client. For example, here's the Claude Desktop configuration to use the above server:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memory": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory"]
    }
  }
}
```

Additional examples might look like:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/path/to/allowed/files"]
    },
    "github": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
      "env": {
        "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "<YOUR_TOKEN>"
      }
    },
    "postgres": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-postgres", "postgresql://localhost/mydb"]
    }
  }
}
```
